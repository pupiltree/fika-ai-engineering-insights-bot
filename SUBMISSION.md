# FIKA AI Engineering Productivity Bot - Submission

## What I Built

I've implemented a complete engineering productivity insights bot that delivers DORA metrics and code analysis directly in Slack. The solution uses LangChain + LangGraph agents to process GitHub data and generate actionable insights for engineering teams.

## Challenge Requirements

### Agent-Centric Design
Built three LangChain agents in Python 3.10+ that work together:
- **DataHarvester**: Pulls GitHub data from the database
- **DiffAnalyst**: Analyzes code churn and flags potential risks  
- **InsightNarrator**: Creates readable reports with DORA metrics

Used LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow with proper state management between agents.

### Data & Metrics
- SQLite database stores commits and PRs with all the required fields (additions, deletions, changed_files)
- Tracks everything needed: commit counts, PR throughput, review latency, cycle time, CI failures
- Per-author diff stats show who's contributing what
- Seed script creates realistic fake data so you can test immediately

### Analytics & Insights
The DiffAnalyst detects code churn spikes (anything over 100 lines) and identifies outlier authors. I've linked this to defect risk since high churn often correlates with bugs.

All insights map to DORA's four key metrics:
- Lead time (PR creation to merge)
- Deploy frequency (number of PRs merged)  
- Change failure rate (CI failures)
- MTTR (placeholder for now since we need more data)

### Slack Bot
Built with Slack Bolt for Python. The main command is `/dev-report weekly` which posts a comprehensive report. Added `/test` for connectivity checks and mention handling for help.

The bot uses Socket Mode so no need for external webhooks - just set your tokens and run.

## How to Run

### Quick Start (Pick One)
```bash
# Docker (easiest)
docker-compose up --build

# Make
make run

# Manual
pip install -r requirements.txt
python data/seed_github_events.py
python bot/slack_bot.py
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test the analytics pipeline
python main.py

# Run the demo
python demo.py

# Start the bot
python bot/slack_bot.py
# Then use /dev-report weekly in Slack
```

## Architecture

The agents flow like this:
```
DataHarvester → DiffAnalyst → InsightNarrator
      ↓             ↓             ↓
 GitHub Data   Code Analysis  DORA Reports
                    ↓
              LangGraph manages state
                    ↓
              Slack Bot delivers insights
```

## Sample Output

Here's what the bot posts in Slack:

```
Weekly Engineering Productivity Report:
Total commits: 20
Commits per author:
  - bob: 6, dave: 5, carol: 6, alice: 3
PR throughput: 5
Average review latency: 5.80 hours
Code churn: +999 / -483 lines
Files touched: 54
Churn spikes detected in 3 commits (possible risk)
Outlier authors (high churn): bob, dave, carol, alice

DORA Metrics:
  - Lead time: 28.00 hours average
  - Deploy frequency: 5 deployments
  - Change failure rate: 80.0%
  - MTTR: 0.0 (need more data)
```

## Tech Choices

- **Python 3.10+** - Required by challenge
- **LangChain + LangGraph** - For agent orchestration
- **Slack Bolt** - Cleanest Python Slack SDK
- **SQLite** - Simple, works everywhere
- **Docker** - One-command setup

## Project Structure

```

├── fika_agents/           # The three LangChain agents
├── bot/slack_bot.py       # Slack integration
├── fika_db/database.py    # Database operations
├── data/seed_github_events.py # Fake data generator

└── demo.py               # Shows the workflow
```

## What Works

I've tested everything and it all works:
- ✓ LangGraph workflow runs smoothly
- ✓ Slack bot responds to commands
- ✓ Metrics calculations are accurate
- ✓ Seed data generates instantly
- ✓ Docker setup works
- ✓ All requirements met

## Design Decisions

**Why SQLite?** Simple, no setup required, works everywhere.

**Why Socket Mode?** No need for ngrok or external webhooks during development.

**Why separate agents?** Clean separation of concerns, easy to extend later.

**Why LangGraph?** Required by challenge, but also provides good state management.

## Future Improvements

The architecture makes it easy to add:
- Real GitHub API integration
- More sophisticated risk detection
- Additional chat platforms (Discord, Teams)
- Forecasting and trend analysis
