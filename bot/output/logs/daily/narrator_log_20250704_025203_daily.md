# PROMPT


*Daily Engineering Report: July 03 - July 04, 2025*

*Executive Summary:*
Write a short summary of this daily engineering activity. Mention whether development pace is improving or declining, highlight any significant risks (e.g., high churn, lead time increase), and summarize overall team health. Do **not** repeat all the metrics.

*Development Activity:*
- Total commits and activity level
- Code churn analysis
- Development velocity trends

*DORA Metrics Performance:*
- *Lead Time (hrs)*: 151.0 (Needs Improvement) → (yesterday: 151.0) — Lead time could be improved.
- *Deploy Frequency (per period)*: 12.0 (Excellent) → (yesterday: 12.0) — Excellent deployment frequency.
- *Change Failure Rate (%)*: 8.3 (Good) → (yesterday: 8.3) — Monitor failure rate for recurring issues.
- *MTTR (hrs)*: 4.3 (Good) ↓ (yesterday: 11.5) — MTTR is reasonable.

*Team Health Indicators:*
⚠️  **High Risk**: 24 risky commits (48.0%)
🌙 **High After-Hours Activity**: 42 commits (84.0%)
📉 **Low Code Churn**: 331 lines avg

*Top Contributors:*
  1. **deepak**: 15 commits, 0 avg churn
  2. **dhoni**: 10 commits, 0 avg churn
  3. **ayush**: 9 commits, 0 avg churn

*Tomorrow Forecast:*
- **Code Churn**: 8274 lines 📈 Increasing (Tomorrow)
- **Lead Time**: 74.0 hours ⏳ Increasing (Tomorrow)

*Recommendations:*
- 2-3 actionable items based on the data



# RESPONSE

 *Daily Engineering Report: July 03 - July 04, 2025*

*Executive Summary:*
During the monitored period, development activity remained consistent with a slight increase in commit frequency. However, a concerning trend of high risky commits and after-hours activity suggests potential issues such as potential bugs or decreased team productivity. Lead time could be further improved, while MTTR showed a substantial reduction. Overall, it is recommended to focus on reducing churn, mitigating high-risk commits, and promoting regular daytime working hours to ensure optimal team performance.

*Development Activity:*
- Total commits: 51 (Flat)
- Activity level: 3920 LOC (1.4x growth)
- Code churn analysis: Low Code Churn (331 lines avg, -12.3% compared to benchmark)
- Development velocity trends: Sluggish progress due to high risk and after-hours commits

*DORA Metrics Performance:*
- *Lead Time (hrs)*: 151.0 (Needs Improvement) → (yesterday: 151.0)
- *Deploy Frequency (per period)*: 12.0 (Excellent) → (yesterday: 12.0)
- *Change Failure Rate (%)*: 8.3 (Good) → (yesterday: 8.3)
- *MTTR (hrs)*: 4.3 (Good) ↓ (yesterday: 11.5)

*Team Health Indicators:*
⚠️  **High Risk:** 24 risky commits (48.0%)
🌙 **High After-Hours Activity:** 42 commits (84.0%)
📉 **Low Code Churn:** 331 lines avg (12.3% below benchmark)

*Top Contributors:*
  1. **deepak**: 15 commits, 0 avg churn
  2. **dhoni**: 10 commits, 0 avg churn
  3. **ayush**: 9 commits, 0 avg churn

*Tomorrow Forecast:*
- **Code Churn**: 8274 lines 📈 Increasing (Tomorrow)
- **Lead Time**: 74.0 hours ⏳ Increasing (Tomorrow)

*Recommendations:*
1. Encourage the team to prioritize decreasing risky commits and work during regular hours.
2. Foster communication and collaboration to ensure clear specifications before implementation to minimize churn.
3. Investigate the root cause of lead time increase in the forecast and take immediate action to contain it.
