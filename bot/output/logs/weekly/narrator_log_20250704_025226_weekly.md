# RESPONSE

 *Executive Summary:*
This weekly engineering report highlights the development activity from June 27 - July 04, 2025. While the development pace remains steady, it is concerning that the team's overall lead time has persisted at 151.0 hours (Needs Improvement), showing a lack of progress in reducing development cycle times. The team performance on DORA metrics produced mixed results, with a high number of risky commits (48.0%) and heightened after-hours activity (84.0%), indicating potential burnout or inadequate resource allocation.

*Development Activity:*
- Total commits and activity level: The team made 42 commits, maintaining a consistent pace compared to previous weeks.
- Code churn analysis: The team produced low code churn of 331 lines on average, which, while normally preferable, may indicate insufficient refactoring or extensive focus on new features.
- Development velocity trends: The team's development velocity remains steady, with a stable rate of work completion.

*DORA Metrics Performance:*
- Lead Time (hrs): 151.0 (Needs Improvement) - The team's lead time remains high, and efforts should be dedicated to identifying bottlenecks and streamlining processes.
- Deploy Frequency (per period): 12.0 (Excellent) - The team's excellent deployment frequency indicates a healthy commitment to continuous delivery.
- Change Failure Rate (%): 8.3 (Good) - Monitor ongoing issues to ensure that the rate does not rise and lead to further complications.
- MTTR (hrs): 9.6 (Good) - Although the resolution time is reasonable, investigating the recent MTTR increase (from 3.0 last week) may help identify potential churn or other obstacles affecting the team.

*Team Health Indicators:*
- High Risk: 24 risky commits (48.0%) - Review risky commits for potential issues and consider refactoring or splitting them into smaller tasks.
‚ö†Ô∏è  **High Risk**: 42 commits (84.0%) - After-hours activity indicates burnout or suboptimal resource management, necessitating attention to workload distribution and promoting work-life balance.
üìâ **Low Code Churn**: 331 lines avg - Low code churn may suggest inadequate refactoring, making it crucial to prioritize maintenance tasks in addition to new development.

*Top Contributors:*
1. **deepak**: 15 commits, 0 avg churn
2. **dhoni**: 10 commits, 0 avg churn
3. **ayush**: 9 commits, 0 avg churn

*Next Week Forecast:*
- **Code Churn**: 8274 lines üìà Increasing (Next Week) - Anticipate a sizable increase in code churn, prompting the team to prepare for potentially more maintenance work and potential code reorganization.
- **Lead Time**: 74.0 hours ‚è≥ Increasing (Next Week) - Based on the current workload and pace, lead times may increase in the following week, necessitating focused efforts to improve processes and streamline development cycles.

*Recommendations:*
1. Examine high-risk commits and after-hours activity to address potential burnout and resource management issues.
2. Improve team communication and collaboration to identify bottlenecks and streamline development processes.
3. Prioritize efforts to reduce lead time, emphasizing code quality and refactoring to address low code churn.
